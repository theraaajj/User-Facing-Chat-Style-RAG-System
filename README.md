# User-Facing-Chat-Style-RAG-System
A full-stack, locally hosted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that lets users query U.S. Federal Register documents using natural language. This project integrates a scheduled data pipeline, a local LLM (via Ollama), and tool-calling with FastAPI to deliver contextual, accurate responses.
